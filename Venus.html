planet to the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days. It is the brightest natural object
in the night sky, except for the Moon. Venus reaches its maximum brightness shortly before
sunrise or shortly after sunset, for which reason it is often called the Morning Star or the
Evening Star. Classified as a terrestrial planet, it is sometimes called Earth’s “sister planet”,
for the two are similar in size, gravity, and bulk composition.However, it has also been shown to 
be radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four 
terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. Theatmospheric pressure at the<br> 
planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth's.With a mean surface temperature of <br>735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), 
Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar<br> System</font></p>
