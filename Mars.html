<p><font size="6" style="times new roman" color="#E0E0E0">Mars is the fourth planet 
from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. 
Named after the Roman god of war, it is often described as the "Red Planet" because 
the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. A terrestrial planet 
with a thin atmosphere, Mars has surface features reminiscent both of the impact 
craters of the Moon<br>and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.
It is the<br>site of Olympus Mons, the highest known mountain in the solar<br>system, and 
of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon. In addition<br>to its geographical features, Mars’
rotational period and seaonal<br>cycles are likewise similar to those of Earth.<br><br>

launched by The Indian Space<br>Research Organization has successfully reached the Mars<br>orbit. ISRO launched the Mars Orbiter Mission,<br>
 Mangalyaan, on November 5, 2013, with the aim of<br>analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography. 
The<br>Mars Orbiter Mission used a Hohmann transfer orbit to<br>escape Earth's gravitational influence and 
catapult into a<br>nine-month-long voyage to Mars. The mission is the first<br>successful Asian interplanetary
 mission</font></p>
