Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and it is third largest planet in the solar system.
<br>It has the fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. It was the first planet <br>discovered
in modern times. It is visible to the naked eye like the five classical<br> planets, but it was never 
recognized as a planet by ancient observers due to its <br>dimness. Like the other giant planets, 
Uranus has a ring system, a magneto-<br>sphere, and numerous moons.It is the only planet whose name 
is derived <br>from a figure from Greek mythology rather than Roman mythology like <br>the other planets, 
from the Latinized version of the Greek god of the sky,<br> Ouranos. Like the other giant planets, 
Uranus has a ring system, a mag-<br>netosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique 
<br>configuration among those of the planets because its axis of rotation is<br> tilted sideways, nearly 
into the plane of its revolution about the Sun. Its <br>north and south poles therefore lie where most 
other planets have their <br>equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as a virtually <br>
featureless planet in visible light without the cloud bands or storms <br>associated with the other 
giants. Terrestrial observers have seen signs of <br>seasonal change and increased weather activity in 
recent years as Uranus <br>approached its equinox. The wind speeds on Uranus can reach 250 meters per<br> 
second (900 km/h, 560 mph).
