<p><font size="6" style="times new roman" color="#E0E0E0">The Moon (Latin: Luna) 
is the Earth's only natural satellite. Although not the <br>largest natural 
satellite in the Solar System, it is, among the satellites of major <br>planets, the 
largest relative to the size of the object it orbits (its primary) and,<br> 
after Jupiter's satellite Io, it is the second most dense satellite among those<br> 
whose densities are known. its surface is actually dark, with a reflectance <br>just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt
The Moon's gravitational <br>influence produces the ocean tides and the slight lengthening of the day.<br> 
The Moon's current orbital distance is about thirty times the diameter of<br> Earth, causing it to have 
an apparent size in the sky almost the same as <br>that of the Sun. This allows the Moon to cover the Sun 
nearly precisely<br> in total solar eclipse.The Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth<br> on which humans 
have currently set foot. The Soviet Union's Luna <br>programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned 
spacecraft in <br>1959; the United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned<br> missions to date, 
beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by<br> Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned lunar landings 
between 1969 and 1972, with the <br>first being Apollo 11. These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks, 
which have<br> been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origin, the formation of <br>its internal 
structure, and its subsequent history.
Future manned missions to the Moon have<br> been planned, including government as well as privately funded efforts. 
The Moon remains, <br>under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.
