<p><font size="6" style="times new roman" color="#E0E0E0">Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, 
orbiting the Sun<br>once every 88 days. Physically, Mercury is similar in appearance<br>to the Moon as it is heavily
cratered. It has no natural satellites<br>and no substantial atmosphere.The planet has a large iron core.<br>Seen from Earth,
it appears to move around its orbit in about<br> 116 days, which is much faster than any other planet. It has no <br>known 
natural satellites.The planet is named after the Roman<br>deity Mercury, the messenger to the gods.</font></p>
<br>
<p><font size="6" style="times new roman" color="#E0E0E0">Because Mercury moves in an orbit around the Sun that lies within Earth's<br>
 orbit (as does Venus), it can appear in Earth's sky in the morning or the evening, but not in the middle of the night. Also, like 
Venus and the Moon, it displays a complete range of phases as it moves around its orbit relative to Earth. Although Mercury can appear
 as a bright object when viewed from Earth, its proximity to the Sun makes it more difficult to see than Venus.</font></p>
