<p><font size="6" style="times new roman" color="#E0E0E0">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second 
largest planet in the Solar System, after Jupiter. Along with the planets Jupiter, 
Uranus, and Neptune, it is classified as a gas giant. The planet Saturn is primarily 
composed of hydrogen, with small proportions of helium and trace elements. The interior 
consists of a small core of rock and ice, surrounded by a thick layer of metallic hydrogen 
and a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a prominent ring system that consists of nine continuous 
main rings and three discontinuous arcs, composed mostly of ice particles with a smaller amount 
of rocky debris and dust. Sixty-two known moons orbit the planet; fifty-three are officially 
named.This&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp does not include the 
hundreds of "moonlets" comprising the rings.&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Titan, Saturn's largest and the Solar System's second<br> largest moon, is larger than 
the planet Mercury <br>and is the only moon in the Solar System to <br>retain a substantial atmosphere.</font></p>
