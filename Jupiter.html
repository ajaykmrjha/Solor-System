Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and largest planet in the solar system. 
It<br>is two and a half times as massive as all of the other planets in our solar<br> system 
combined. The plane is primarily composed of hydrogen with a<br>small proportion of helium;
it may also have a rocky core of heavier<br> elements. Because of its rapid rotation the planet
is an oblate spheroid. It<br> is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth of that of the Sun but is 
two and<br> a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System<br> combined. Jupiter 
is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus<br>and Neptune. Together, these four
planets are sometimes referred to as<br>the Jovian or outer planets. There are also at least 67 moons,
including<br> the four large moons called the Galilean moons that were first discovered<br> by Galileo Galilei 
in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these moons, has a<br> diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.
