Neptune is the eighth and farthest known planet from the Sun in the 
Solar System. It is the fourth largest planet by diameter, and the 
third largest by mass; Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth. Neptune’s 
atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with traces of 
methane that account for the planet’s blue appearance. Neptune’s blue colour 
is much more vivid than that of Uranus, which has a similar amount of methane, 
so an unknown component is presumed to cause Neptune’s intense colour.

Neptune was the first planet found by mathematical prediction rather than by 
empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis 
Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by 
an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed on 23 September 1846 by 
Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier, and 
its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the 
planet's remaining 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. 
Neptune has been visited by one spacecraft, Voyager 2, which flew by the planet 
on 25 August 1989.
